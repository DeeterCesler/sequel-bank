# Sequel Bank: the Next Best Thing in Banking

4. Run `php artisan db:seed`
5. Run `php artisan serve`
6. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Notes

To get this to work, I intentionally did not use Laravel's built-in input sanitization.

<!-- feel free to use this code as you please -->

This database is *supposed* to be experimented on, so don't worry if you break it.
The DB resets every day so you don't need to clean up after yourself.
